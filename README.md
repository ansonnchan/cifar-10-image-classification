# cifar-10-image-classification
An introductory image classfication project using PyTorch on the CIFAR-10 dataset. 

## Overview
This project implements an image classification pipeline using PyTorch on the CIFAR-10 dataset.  
It includes:  
- Data preprocessing and normalization  
- Fully connected neural network architecture  
- Training and validation loops  
- Model evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix  
- Visualization of training history and sample predictions  
- Saving and loading trained models

## Dependencies
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- `torch`  
- `torchvision`  
- `numpy`  (could be installed already)
- `matplotlib`  
- `seaborn`  (could be installed already)
- `sklearn' OR 'scikit-learn`  

You can install them using the following command on Command Prompt (or any command line interface0
